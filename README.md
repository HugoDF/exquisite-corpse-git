# Exquisite Corpse Git

This is the project repository for the Git for Creatives course.

We will create an Exquisite Corpse in multiple languages. An exquisite corpse is a way of writing a story with each person adding a sentence to what was previously there (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse)).

Some guidelines: 
- Try to avoid peeking in the txt files before thinking of your sentence
- Your pull request and commit messages should not hint at what you've written too obviously
- Do start corpses in other languages :)

We're collaborating on the [english-corpse.txt](english-corpse.txt) file. If you know any other language feel free to add a `{language-name}-corpse.txt` file and start one there (it might be easier to just translate the start of the English exquisite corpse).
